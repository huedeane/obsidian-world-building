### Overview
---
Function as reservoirs for spiritual essence, allowing individuals to store and utilize it for later purposes. Since one's spiritual essence has daily limits, these artifacts are essential for maximizing magical potential. Possessing multiple artifacts enables a person to cast spells beyond their individual capacity, equivalent to the combined power of multiple individuals. However, acquiring these artifacts can be costly, as they require significant time to fill with essence. Users typically fill them gradually by storing any excess spiritual essence they can regenerate each day.
