### Overview  
---  
Crafted by artificers, artifacts are a more enduring form of essence-imbued items. Due to this, it's easier to verify them for authenticity. Their diverse forms often lead to specialized equipment based on their unique attributes. However, due to their lasting nature, the production of artifacts is a time-consuming and energy-intensive process. They are a less intense version of scrolls in their possession ability, requiring more setup before one can bring out their full potential. Care must be taken in selecting artifacts, given their specialized nature and varying creators, making it challenging to find synergy when matching them together.
