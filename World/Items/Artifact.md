### Overview  
---  
  
Crafted by artificers, artifacts are a more enduring form of essence-imbued items. Due to this, it's easier to verify them for authenticity. Their diverse forms often lead to specialized equipment based on their unique attributes. However, due to their lasting nature, the production of artifacts is a time-consuming and energy-intensive process. They are a less intense version of scrolls in their possession ability, requiring more setup before one can bring out their full potential. Care must be taken in selecting artifacts, given their specialized nature and varying creators, making it challenging to find synergy when matching them together.  
  
__Cursed artifacts:__ Imbued with possession abilities akin to scrolls, in direct violation of safety guidelines, as they are seen more as extensions of oneself rather than mere manifestations of one's abilities. They possess significantly greater power and potency compared to regular artifacts. However, prolonged uses gradually erodes one's will, rendering them considerably more hazardous. The creation of these artifacts requires an immense amount of spiritual essence, often resulting in the demise of the creator.  
  
__Transient artifacts:__ Crafted alongside forgers. They are specialized artifacts, a conduit-hybrid, designed to be as minimal as possible to conserve space. With a predetermined shape imparted onto the object, one can utilize restoration techniques to fully manifest the weapon. Because the weapon is conjured, it may not be as durable or efficient for long-term use as if it were physically made. However, it is infinitely more versatile.  
  
__Ethereal artifacts:__ Function as reservoirs for spiritual essence, allowing individuals to store and utilize it for later purposes. Since one's spiritual essence has daily limits, these artifacts are essential for maximizing magical potential. Possessing multiple artifacts enables a person to cast spells beyond their individual capacity, equivalent to the combined power of multiple individuals. However, acquiring these artifacts can be costly, as they require significant time to fill with essence. Users typically fill them gradually by storing any excess spiritual essence they can regenerate each day.
