### Overview  
---  
Conduits serve as intermediaries, adept at extracting magical essence from around them and transforming it into a specific magical properties. The majority of humans struggle to conjure magical properties, so they rely heavily on the use of conduits. They are meticulously crafted by a sorcerer, imbuing in them the weight of all their knowledge dedicated to creating the properties they specialize in throughout their entire life. Activating a conduit is as simple as injecting one's spiritual essence into it. It then uses that essence to extract magical essence from its surroundings, to then conjure the properties embedded within itself. Once formed, the magical property is attached to one's spiritual essence, allowing the user to manipulate it. The magical properties produced by conduits are not as potent as the real thing, yet they are still essential.
