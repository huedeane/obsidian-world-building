Once a divine vessel has fully embraced its role in the universe and completed its journey and process of convergence, it roams the universe in search of a suitable space. It gathers the cosmic essence around it, forming its own magical essence binding and becoming a celestial body. Once fully realized, its new purpose is to give birth to new life, deriving from its own soul. Its inhabitants are acclimated to cosmic essence through its magical essence, with the hope of forming more divine vessels to continue the cycle.
