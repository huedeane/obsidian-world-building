### Overview  
___  
Artificial vessels are created by forcefully trapping souls and encapsulating it into a core. Over time, the soul harmonize within the core, resulting in the formation of a physical body that reflects the amalgamation of some of the spirits' past physical forms. Although this process is slow, it produces beings that are more in tune with their soul. Unlike natural vessels, they rely on their core as their single point of failure. Their physical body serves to protect the core and is expendable so long as the core remains intact.
