### Overview  
___  
  
The most common type of vessel forms naturally within a world, consisting of a fragment of soul separated from the planet. Once a physical body has sufficiently developed, the brain generates a spiritual barrier that traps the soul within, preventing it from dispersing. As the body matures, the spirit grows alongside it, fully developing within the vessel. However, this kind of vessel is highly vulnerable to physical harm, as it relies on the body's integrity to maintain the barrier that contains the soul.
