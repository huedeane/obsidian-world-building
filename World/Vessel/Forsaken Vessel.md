___  
  
Forsaken vessels are ascended vessels that have fallen from grace, succumbing once again to worldly desires. Having spent enough time as divine vessels to comprehend the power of cosmic essence, they use the power of law to create special conditions that allow them to continue existing within the world. These conditions are taxing and require a significant amount of essence to maintain and grow. Forsaken vessels often exploit their surroundings, draining any energy they can to sustain and enhance their own existence. Their new role in the universe is to curtail its expansion, testing the validity of existence of other vessels.
