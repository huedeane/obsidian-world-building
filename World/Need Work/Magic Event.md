Arena Ranking System  
-> At first, your ranking in the arena was based on a tier, equivalent to the number of spiritual techniques you knew. However, an issue arose when individuals in the same tier displayed different skill levels. This led to the tier system being split into two groups: scholars and combatants.  
  
-> **Scholars** -> Based on how many spiritual techniques you are proficient in, indicating your maximum potential.  
  
-> **Combatants** -> Based on merit, proficiency in a spiritual technique doesn't guarantee you being able to use it to its full potential in combat. Instead, you increase this through feats of defeating strong opponents.
