-> Potion are like scroll, but instead of focusing on the user taking control and performing the spell, it instead emphaised me on apply the spell effect onto a user.  
-> because of this they are not mainly used for direct combat, but for healing, and buffing the player  
-> Instead of a set efficiency level, the efficiency is instead varied by the amount of liquid that is drinked or applied  
-> Stuff can be included in the potion to enhance the effect, like herb to futher affect increase healing of the body  
-> Knowledge of medicine is incredibly useful
