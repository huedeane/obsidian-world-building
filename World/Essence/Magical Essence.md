### Overview

  When a new world is born, cosmic essence transforms into a more specialized form of energy with laws attached to it that allow the world to take form and operate as intended. It serves as a more accessible energy source for individuals native to that world, assisting them in harnessing their powers on their journey to understanding cosmic essence. When harnessed, it grants users the power of magic. Although these essences are seemingly everywhere, they are resistant to being gathered forcefully, as they are influenced by the spiritual essence enveloping the world. Those more attuned to the spiritual nature of their environment find it easier to gather and use magical essence. Since this essence originates from the world, using it signifies binding oneself to the world. Individuals who abstain from its use are symbolizing their rejection of the world, a crucial step in attaining enlightenment and transcending their physical bodies.
