### Overview  
---  
Spiritual essence, often referred to as one's spirit, is infused with will. Life forms around this essence, encapsulating it and utilizing its energy to interact with the physical world. The nature of one's spirit is volatile, and without a proper vessel, it will eventually disperse. The primary purpose of one's spirit is to enable their vessel to take action. Spirit does not retain memory, but its will reflects the history of actions taken or imparted onto them. This is why a vessel is important, as it allows one to alter their will through the collection of memories and experiences.
