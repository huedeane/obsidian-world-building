### Overview
---
Floating in the vastness of space, souls are inevitably drawn back toward the Plane of Creation, located at the center of the universe. To reach it, they must possess an unwavering will, free from all desires except the longing to merge with the universe itself. Only by shedding their earthly attachments can they succeed in this journey. Those who reach the Plane converge back into a singular entity, becoming one with the god that gave birth to them. Once enough souls have gathered and the reunion is complete, the god detaches a portion of itself once more, beginning the cycle anew and continuing the expansion of the universe.
