### Overview

Amidst these wars, the true nature of magical essence is revealed—not merely a force to sustain the world, but a potent energy granted to its inhabitants. Distilled from cosmic essence, it becomes a source that mortals can understand and wield, enabling them to create magic and defend against the threats that endanger their world. Yet, this power alone is insufficient to challenge the apostles of the demigod, who draw strength through contracts with the demigod, granting them access to the power of law. In response, the planet itself forges a pact with certain inhabitants. By voluntarily severing their ties to the ascension cycle, they are bound to the world as eternal guardians. In return, they gain direct access to the planet’s full reserves. Though this grants immense strength, it is up to each individual’s potential to fully harness this power, as their strength scales with the influence a demigod has over the individual they face. This is why apostles often hide and manipulate unaffiliated individuals to fight for them—preventing the guardians from exerting their full power.
