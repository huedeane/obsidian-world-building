### Overview
---
Demigods cannot attack celestial entities directly, lest they incur the wrath of the celestial as a whole. Instead, they form pacts with inhabitants of the world to undermine the planet from within. Some of these beings become direct apostles of the demigod, entrusted with the grand purpose of establishing a Nest.  
  
A Nest mimics the planet in one crucial way: any soul that dies within its boundaries does not return to the planet but instead becomes trapped within the Nest. Over time, these souls merge into an amalgamation, which the apostle uses to forge new life by creating artificial vessels to trap them. Eventually, life is born from these vessels, inheriting the combined physical traits of the many souls that perished within the Nest. These beings are inherently superior to most other entities, though at the cost of their low numbers. These beings are known as spirits.  
  
Spirits are not inherently antagonistic—they are, after all, composed of the same souls that once lived on the planet. However, due to the nature of the Nest, the spirits are intrinsically linked to one another, resonating on the same wavelength. This connection fosters a collective society, more unified and harmonious than typical mortal civilizations.  
  
Still, the emergence of these new lifeforms poses a perceived threat to the planet’s original inhabitants, who fear the rise of entities that could rival their existence. As the Nest grows, so too does the animosity of the world’s natives. Through this tension, conflict inevitably erupts between the two, plunging the world into chaos.  
  
Once a single spirit senses danger, the shared resonance causes that fear to ripple across the entire Nest, pulling all spirits into the conflict. What begins as a spark becomes an all-consuming war, dragging both sides into prolonged strife.  
  
In truth, this is the Nest’s intended purpose—to ignite conflict and destabilize the planet. As the world weakens under the strain of war, the demigod’s true objective is revealed: with planetary resistance diminished, they are able to inject their will directly into the Nest, seizing complete control of all the spirits within. Through them, the demigod spreads even greater chaos, further unraveling the world. Once the planet is sufficiently broken, the demigod can finally manifest a vessel of themselves in the physical realm to finish the job.
