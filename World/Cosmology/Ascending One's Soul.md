### Overview
---
When life is born, its will is deeply intertwined with the world that birthed it, making it difficult to break free from the mortal cycle. Only after the soul endures a strenuous journey and relinquishes its earthly desires can it shed the shackles of the world. Once freed, the soul may transcend its origins, leave the planet, and seek a higher purpose‚Äîdiscovering its place within the vast expanse of the universe.
