### Overview
---
As new life is born, they sustain themselves by feeding on the natural resources produced by the planet, all teeming with the very essence from which they were created, helping to maintain their bodies. Through the natural joining of two souls, each detaches a portion of themselves, which then fuses together to give birth to a new being. With that, life flourishes and multiplies. As they die, their soul returns to the planet, leaving behind some residue on the surface, while the rest is absorbed back into the planet. This process fuels the birth of new life, continuing the cycle of existence.
