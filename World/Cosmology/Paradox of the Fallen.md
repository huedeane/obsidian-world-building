### Overview
---
The souls that fail their journey toward the Plane of Creation falter because they have not fully rid themselves of selfish desires, still questioning their purpose in this long and arduous journey. Lacking the will to complete their path, they remain stranded in the vastness of space, endlessly crafting new purposes for their existence. In this emptiness, over the passage of time, they eventually discover the cosmic essence that surrounds them. After much struggle, they learn to harness this energy, using it to form new vessels and rise as demigods. Their new desire becomes one of power‚Äîseeking to control more of the cosmic essence to fuel their growth. While not as powerful as celestial entities, they often seek them out, siphoning their power from a distance to further their ascent. More often than not, the celestial entities they pursue are those who originally gave birth to them.  
  
Though it may seem that their existence is unintended, their role is essential. They serve as the reclaimer of the universe, cleansing the cosmos of dead celestial entities and those that have stagnated. Their presence poses a constant threat to the stability of existing celestial beings, forcing them to evolve continuously in order to survive. They are a living paradox‚Äîdefying their purpose, yet their very existence upholds the cosmic balance.
