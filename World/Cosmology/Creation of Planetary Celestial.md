### Overview
---
From the Plane of Creation, fragments of the singular God are cast into the ever-expanding universe. Once they sense they have reached their destined location, they begin to take form as celestial entities—such as suns, moons, and planets. These Planetary celestial absorb the surrounding cosmic essence and converts it into magical essence—a simplified yet specialized form of energy. Using it, they give form to the fundamental laws that define their creation. From this essence, all matter and structure take form, though they lack the spark of life. To ensure the world is teeming with life, the celestial then detach a portions of their own souls, creating vessels to which hold them in place. Eventually bodies are from from these allowing the soul the ability to interact with the physical world. The celestial then step back, allowing nature to take its course, vowing not to intervene except in instances when the world they have created faces an existential threat.
