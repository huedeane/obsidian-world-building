### Overview

Should this incursion lead to the death of both the world and the demigod, the fundamental will that once bound all souls together dissolves into chaos. These souls, having never undertaken the journey to shed their selfish desires, become entirely consumed by them. They fight among themselves until one soul ultimately prevails and subjugates the rest. This new entity becomes a demigod—one whose power rivals that of a celestial.  
  
Such a transformation is exceedingly rare; even when a world perishes, it typically requires the combined efforts of many demigods, who then divide the spoils among themselves. However, this new type of demigod is a wildcard—unpredictable, chaotic, and capable of disrupting the very fabric of the cosmos. Their existence serves a singular purpose: to prevent God from becoming stagnant, forcing constant adaptation in the face of a force that cannot be ignored. Should this challenge go unmet, it may mark the beginning of the universe’s end, as all creation collapses upon itself.
