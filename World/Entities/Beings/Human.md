### Overview

Humans, the most common form of intellectual entity in the world, were once the dominant race, but their arrogance led to their downfall. Despite this, they remain the most adaptable and ambitious among the races, exploring the world in search of answers. Living wherever proves valuable, they adapt to their surroundings and establish kingdoms. While they were once at each other's throats, their aggression has lessened with the appearance of spirits threatening their existence. Humans have two forms – their physical and spiritual forms – with one unable to exist without the other. The physical form allows them to maintain a spiritual barrier, preventing their spiritual essence from dissipating. Without their spiritual essence, they become lifeless, devoid of will, unable to act.
