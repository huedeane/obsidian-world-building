### Overview  
---  
Artificially created from a core of trapped spiritual essence, spiritual creatures are considered a higher form of evolution, surpassing humans in all aspects. Due to their unique origin, these creatures boast a heightened affinity for the ways of magic. As the spiritual essence within the core settled into harmony, their perferred physical form goes in development. Although the emerging creature can take any form it want, they are usually influenced by the amalgamation of all their past lives woven together. Their strength lies in their magical prowess and physical abilities, determined by the balance between the essence used to materialize their forms. Those focusing less on physical forms exhibit greater magical proficiency, while those emphasizing form sacrifice magical potential for enhanced physical prowess. However, their vulnerabilities lie in the fragility of their cores and constraints on their numbers.
