### Overview  
---  
Since the world is partially composed of spiritual essence, it possesses a will of its own. It refrains from direct interference with inhabitants unless it perceives a threat. Upon the death of entities within its boundaries, their spiritual essence gets recycled for the world's use. The world's goal is to generate strong-willed spiritual essence capable of surviving the journey to attain godhood. Demigods often seek out worlds for their abundance of essence, forming pacts with individuals within them to undermine the world. To combat this, the world produces sentinels, forming pacts with individuals and allowing them access to its reserves in exchange for dedicating their lives to protecting the world.
