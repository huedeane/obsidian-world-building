### Beings  
---
[[Human]]:  
Humans, once the dominant race, saw their downfall due to their own arrogance. Highly adaptable and ambitious, they explore, setting up kingdoms around the world. Once aggressive towards each other, their focus shifts with the appearance of spirits who threaten their existence.  
  
[[Spirits]]:  
Spirits, artificially created from nests, are an evolved race who are superior to humans. Despite vulnerability from cores and limited numbers, their ability to assume any form and innate heightened magic affinity makes them a formidable force to take down.  
  
[[Demigod]]:  
Demigods are born from unbound spiritual essence that fails to finish their journey. Drifting in space, they discover the secrets of cosmic essence. Their knowledge to understand lead them back to the route of their origin. Unable to directly interfere the world, they form covenants with the inhabitants living in it, granting power in exchange for undermining the world.  
  
[[Aspect]]:  
Having a will of its own, the world refrains from interference with individuals inhabiting it unless threatened. Sought out by demigods for its vast reserves of essence, the world protects itself by creating sentinels. It grants them access to its reserves in exchange for their dedication to protect the world from any threats.
