### Overview
---
An area with a high density of soul that lingers. When an entity dies here, its soul remains much longer than usual. These zones are prized for their ability to induce [[Metasoulmorph]] and contain an abundant of [[Souly]], which is of high strategic value.

### Expanded
---
These areas are very rare and few in number. Little is known about how they form naturally, though artificial versions called nests are known to exist. When present in one of these zones, people often experience a distinct sensation—a strange feeling of heightened connection to the area. Due to their ability to produce [[Souly]], kingdoms often go to war over these areas, as they can single-handedly provide enough resources to fund an entire kingdom. Harvesting too much [[Souly]] reduces the soul density, and excessive extraction can cause irreversible damage to the area’s foundation. These areas can naturally recover as long as creatures continue to die within them and the foundation remains stable.
