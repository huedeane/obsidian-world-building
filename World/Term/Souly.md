### Overview
---
An object that has undergone metasoulmorph, granting it exceptional capacity to contain soul and prevent it from dissipating. [[Souly]] is often used as a material in the creation of [[Scrolls]], [[Artifacts]], and [[Potion]] due to its ability to hold pre-made combat arts and embedded spells for extended periods. However, its potency in retaining soul diminishes over time if not properly maintained.

### Expanded
---
The material that undergoes this process can be of any typeâ€”solid, liquid, or gas. It can even be ground into a fine powder, which is less efficient but allows for wider application.
