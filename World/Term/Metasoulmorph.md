### Overview
---
A process that automatically occurs over time when an object remains within a densely packed area of soul. This process increases the object's ability to retain soul and resist dispersion. This process often occurs in Soul Areas but is not limited to them.

### Expanded
---
The transformation occurs more quickly in inanimate objects than in living beings. This is because living entities naturally possess their own soul, which slows down the process, while inanimate objects do not have this limitation. When applied to inanimate materials, this process results in the creation of [[Souly]], known for their exceptional capacity to contain soul. For living entities, the process doesnâ€™t necessarily make them stronger but increases their resilience against attacks that attempt to strip their soul away, raises the limit of how much soul they can contain, and improves their ability to recover.
