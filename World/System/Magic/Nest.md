### Overview  
---  
In the intricate cycle of life and death, upon an entity's demise, its spiritual essence typically returns to the earth to be recycled. However, nests defy this norm, emerging as specialized zones formed through the application of law. They mimic the earth, trapping any lingering spiritual essence as it slowly converges toward the nest center. Here, a mysterious entity known as the Caretaker orchestrates life by using the amalgamation of spiritual essence grouped together and forming makeshift cores to trap them. Eventually, these cores will give rise to spiritual creatures. Since spiritual essence is comprised of will, its lingering presence in the air affects and influences the inhabitants within the nest. This effect tends to foster the inhabitants to form a collective society. While cooperation thrives, the drawback lies in the susceptibility to erupting wills, as the manifestation of one's desires can gradually subsume others. This vulnerability makes the inhabitants of the nest more susceptible to manipulation, creating a delicate balance within this ethereal ecosystem.
