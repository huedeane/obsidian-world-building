## Prerequisite  
___  
  
__Technique:__  
  
- __Extraction:__ Gather the essence

## Remarks:  
___  
- The amount of essence required is proportional to the object's size, complexity, and density  
- Using a form core, one can skip the need to shape the weapon and instead focus solely on summoning the object, as the form is already embedded within the core  
- Weapons summoned from essence are less durable than their physical counterparts and more susceptible to enemy manipulation
