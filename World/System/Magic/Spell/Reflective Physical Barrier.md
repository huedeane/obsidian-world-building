### Remarks:  
___

- The larger the barrier, the weaker the force is applied in return  
- Due to the high cost of this spell, it should only be used in situations where the user is overwhelmed by physical attacks from all directions  
- The cost of the spell scales exponentially with the number of attacks directed at it, making it very easy to overwhelm  
- Is not very effective against magical attack
