## Remarks:  
___  
- If the souls willingly allow themselves to be assimilated, the efficiency of the spell is drastically improved. However, more often than not, the spell is used for selfish purposes rather than for a collective goal  
- Even if you refuse to assimilate the souls, the sheer number floating around will disrupt the mass reservoir of essence you’ve gathered, making it difficult to cast a follow-up spell  
- The same energy gathered for this spell can be used to increase the output of the Devour, but at the cost of one's sanity, as continuous assimilation of souls takes its toll  
- If one were to lose control from the sheer amount of souls assimilated, the Devouring spell would continue until the user is consumed, triggering a massive explosion as the accumulated essence is forced to disperse.

## History:  
___  
A spell that has been outlawed and actively erased from existence due to its indiscriminate and destructive nature—it consumes everything around it without distinction. Many who attempt to wield it underestimate the strength of will required to control the absorbed souls, often succumbing to madness as a result.
