### Description  
---  
Artificers specialize primarily in the technique of animation, highly sought after for their unparalleled proficiency in crafting magical scrolls and artifacts. Their primary focus is on animation, using it as the basis for all their creations by channeling their will. Infusion serves as a secondary proficiency, providing a channel for their will into an item or entity. They are the most peculiar class, as their main focus is not on their proficiencies since their value is bound to what they can create. Their primary and secondary skills are just prerequisites; their true value lies in their tertiary skills as that determines the variety of what they can create. As magical scholars, they prioritize perfecting techniques over combat. Due to this, they heavily rely on their crafted scrolls and artifacts in battle, often staying in the back. Additionally, they have the ability to create magical entities to assist them. However, their dedication to craftsmanship over efficiency makes them prone to exhaustion.
