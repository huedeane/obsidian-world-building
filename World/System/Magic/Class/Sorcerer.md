### Profession  
---  
**Primary** -> Conjuration  
**Secondary** -> Extraction  
  
### Description  
---  
Sorcerers specialize primarily in the technique of conjuration, focusing on efficiently conjuring a single magical property. They create their own conduits but abstain from using them. Due to their emphasis on conjuring magical properties, their spells are inherently more potent at the expense of their own essence. To sustain magical prowess and match wizards' efficiency, sorcerers delve into a secondary proficiencyâ€”extraction. Extracting essence from the environment, rather than depleting their own, ensures longevity in magical endeavors. While sorcerers may lack wizards' versatility in magical techniques, their strength lies in the raw power and endurance infused into each conjured spell.
