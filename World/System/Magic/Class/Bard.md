### Description  
---  
Bards specialize primarily in transmutation. They rely on the extremity of their emotions to spread their influence. Their secondary proficiencies help them express emotions differently, applying them to individuals, areas, or even completely dominating someone. They can enhance their allies' emotional states or negatively impact enemies. This is troubling for any magic user, as the effectiveness of magic is linked to one's emotional state and concentration. Bards can alter incoming magic or modify their own magical properties to suit their needs in battle. They are a huge nuisance to deal with.
