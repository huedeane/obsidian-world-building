### Profession  
---  
**Primary** -> Restoration  
**Secondary** -> Infusion, Extraction, Shaping  
  
### Description  
---  
Clerics specialize primarily in the technique of restoration, making them adept healers. Their natural resilience, stemming from restoration, enables self-healing. Secondary proficiencies determine their healing approach: Infusion for specialization, Extraction for sustainability, and Shaping for broad, faster healing through expanded spiritual barriers. Each secondary has its advantages and disadvantages, but a cleric is indispensable in battle. Their restoration also lends well to deconstructing magic, allowing them to revert magic back to its origin whether spiritual or magical form.
