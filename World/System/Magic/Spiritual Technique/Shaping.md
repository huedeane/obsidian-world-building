### Overview  
---  
Shaping empowers individuals to imbue essence with form.While altering one's form doesn't immediately affect their physical appearance, it does pivot the origin from which their essence emanates. To truly assume the imparted form, restoration is essential to revert to the original state. Forcing a change in a living entity's shape is challenging, yet mastery enables one to seamlessly polymorph into any desired form bestowed upon them.  
Other such application includes controling over the shape and extent of their spiritual barrier.
