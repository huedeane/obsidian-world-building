-> Restoration can be very dangerous ability to apply to an entity because if applied to an area for too long, you can end up decontructing yourself to energy  
-> This is why restoration should be percisly targeted rather then to be used overall  
-> Healing oneself is alot easier as it is easier to understand one's form, but when apply healing to other people, their form is different making it hard to heal them  
-> restoration can be applied not only for healing but to deconstruct magic  
-> restoration works well with shaping to conjure different weapon  
-> represent the ability of the spirit to heal itself  
-> Good for removing aura or curses
