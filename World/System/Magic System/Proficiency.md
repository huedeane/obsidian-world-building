### Overview  
---  
Due to the limitations of lifespan, proficiency level represents the most efficient way for an individual to further increase the mastery of their technique. A primary proficiency is the main focus of one's life and is considered to be 100% efficient. Secondary proficiency helps one branch out and specialize within their profession, and is considered 75% efficient. Tertiary proficiency serves to cover any weaknesses that arise from specialization, allowing them to be more well-rounded; it is considered 50% efficient until reaching a common cutoff point, where anything beyond diminishes to 25%. This cutoff point is called the learning threshold. Anything past this threshold is called one's specialized proficiency. This is due to the level of growth and understanding of a technique not being linear but exponential. This threshold represents the highest form of basic understanding before one has to specialize; thus, advancing tertiary techniques beyond this point is deemed a waste of time. Techniques developed within this threshold are coined as common techniques, representing skills and abilities that any common person can learn to perform given adequate time.  
  
Such exceptions exist in this system when it comes to efficiency. By forgoing tertiary proficiency to instead match both of their specialized proficiencies to the same level, they can operate both specialties at 100% efficiency. However, it is not advisable to pursue this unless one has a specific purpose. Doing so is discouraged because leveling tertiary classes enhances base consistency, and deviating from this approach risks unbalancing oneself.  
  
### Spell Improvement
