**Primary** -> Projection

### Description  
---  
Illusionists specialize primarily in projection; rather than engaging in direct combat, they rely on the subtle manipulation of perception to confound and bewilder adversaries. By shaping the very essence within an area, they can influence the mental states and actions of those within their grasp. Some are capable of conjuring illusionary figures to distract individuals. They scarcely leave behind traces of manipulation, accumulating unnoticed until it's too late.
