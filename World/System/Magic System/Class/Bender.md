Benders specialize primarily in the technique of manipulation, emphasizing offensive tactics with a wizard-like flair. They accumulate momentum within their barrier, unleashing rapid projectile strikes. Possessing agility and quick reflexes, they keep opponents on edge, swiftly deflecting or hurling magical attacks back at enemies. Their secondary profession is very versatile, as the movement of essence is simple by nature, allowing it to branch into any different path a bender might wish to take to complement their style.
