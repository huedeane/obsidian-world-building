## Remarks:  
___  
- To use it to its fullest potential, one must be quick-witted and possess the skill to interpret all incoming data in order to make effective use of the information  
- Useful for gaining a general layout of the areaâ€”small traces of detected essence represent the environment, larger concentrations indicate living entities, and unusually high amounts may signify the presence of a spell  
- Not useful if you wish to remain hidden, as those detected by this aura can easily trace back your location or, at the very least, make a good estimate of it  
- Not useful in the midst of a large battle, as the chaotic exchange of spells leads to inconsistent readings. However, it can still offer a general sense of the combat's flow. In smaller skirmishes, it proves more effective, helping to anticipate unseen attacks  
- It is often used multiple times to achieve real-time tracking of the area
