## Remarks:  
___  
- Levitation relies on using one's body as the focal point to apply an opposing force that counteracts gravity, lifting the object upward. However, using one's body as a reference is limiting—if one were to lose their sense of orientation from being thrown around, it would require greater mental effort to adjust or maintain the force’s direction. Due to the concentration required to maintain a state of weightlessness, casting additional spells becomes difficult, making levitation more commonly used as a utility rather than for maneuvering. The heavier the object, the harder it is to levitate.  
- The amount of essence needed to levitate an object is proportional to its weight
