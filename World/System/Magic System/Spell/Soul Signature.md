## Remarks:  
___  
- You don't necessarily have to extract the soul from an individual; it can also be done with a spell or any lingering remnant of the soul  
- Unless one is focused, it is easy for the soul to leak out of one's spiritual barrier. Due to this, there is plenty of soul remnant in the air that you can pull from  
- The more concentrated the soul is, the faster its signature can be analyzed and imprinted
