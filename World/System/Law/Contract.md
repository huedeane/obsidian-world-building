### Overview  
---  
The most challenging form of law application occurs when one can specifically apply it to an entity. Unlike a domain where everything within the space is affected, targeting an individual requires a significant trade-off in one aspect, either to oneself or to the targeted entity, to achieve an effective outcome. Since every spiritual entity inherently possesses a natural resistance to law, this task becomes doubly difficult. Bypassing this resistance is possible with by overloading the quantity of cosmic essence, but such a method is hardly efficient.
