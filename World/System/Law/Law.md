### Overview  
---  
Law is the capacity to utilize cosmic essence for the manipulation and alteration of the fundamental laws of the universe. It's an intricate process that requires a profound understanding of the law being manipulated. One can modify existing laws or create new ones by accumulating changes from various existing base laws. In a confrontation between laws, it becomes complex as laws cannot be outright dismissed; instead, they can be nullified with an equal opposing law or stacked on top of another, augmenting their effects. All spiritual entities inherently possess a natural resistance to law. To ensure the effectiveness of any applied law, there must be a corresponding tradeoff made to enhance the desired effect. Examples of fundamental laws include gravity, time, and existence. There are different types of techniques one can implement with law, including Covenant (oneself), Domain (to an area), and Contract (to another entity).  
  
### Type of Law  
---  
[[Convenant]]:  
Individuals commonly apply law to themselves in a practice called a covenant. The effectiveness depends on the trade-off magnitude, making it potent for one targeting their self who already has a clear understanding of their limitations.  
  
[[Domain]]:  
When an individual applies their unique blend of law in an open space, this area is termed a domainâ€”an environment meticulously crafted by the user to aid them in battle. It represents the most effective form of applying law, since it affects everyone there isn't a need for a trade-off.  
  
[[Contract]]:  
Law applied to another entity is termed a contract. As spiritual entities inherently resist law, applying it to them is doubly difficult unless they willingly accept. One can overcome this resistance by overloading the amount of essence spent, though this method is inefficient.
