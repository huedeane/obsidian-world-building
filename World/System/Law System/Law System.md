### Overview  
---  
Law is the capacity to utilize cosmic essence for the manipulation and alteration of the fundamental laws of the universe. It's an intricate process that requires a profound understanding of the law being manipulated. One can modify existing laws or create new ones by accumulating changes from various existing base laws. In a confrontation between laws, it becomes complex as laws cannot be outright dismissed; instead, they can be nullified with an equal opposing law or stacked on top of another, augmenting their effects. All spiritual entities inherently possess a natural resistance to law. To ensure the effectiveness of any applied law, there must be a corresponding tradeoff made to enhance the desired effect. Examples of fundamental laws include gravity, time, and existence. There are different types of techniques one can implement with law, including Covenant (oneself), Domain (to an area), and Contract (to another entity).
