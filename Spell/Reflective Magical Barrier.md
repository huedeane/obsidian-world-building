## Description:  
---  
Implement an aura over one's soul barrier that takes control of any spell making contact with it, redirecting it in another direction. The longer the spell persists within the barrier, the greater the control the aura exerts over it.

## Remarks:  
___  
- Due to the high cost of this spell, it should only be used in situations where the user is overwhelmed by spells from all directions.  
- Effective against piercing spells, as it seeks to redirect the attack rather than block it.  
- The larger the barrier, the weaker the force of the redirect  
- It is not effective against physical attacks, as the lack of magical energy makes it difficult to controlâ€”unless the attack is delivered through a magical weapon
