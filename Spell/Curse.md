___  
- It alters the user's emotions and actions, preventing them from removing it  
- One must have a higher understanding of transmutation or animation to overcome it; otherwise, it becomes increasingly difficult to resist  
- A highly complex spell; for full effectiveness, it must be prepared in advance; otherwise, its effects may be too weak  
- A powerful enough curse might even compel you to stop others from helping you get rid of it  
- Often used to prolong one's suffering rather than for combat; but when purposed for battle, its effects are subtle and last only brief moments
