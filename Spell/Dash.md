## Attribute  
___  
- __Cost:__ Low  
- __Target:__ Manual  
- __Range:__ Short - Medium  
- __Cast Time:__ Instant  
- __Cast Type:__ Single  
- __Duration:__ Instant  
- __Complexity:__ Basic  
- __Depth:__ High  
  
## Prerequisite:  
___  
  
__Technique:__  
- __Enhancement:__ Compress energy to achieve burst speed.  
- __Manipulation:__ Control your direction of travel.  
- __Animate (Optional):__ Chain multiple dash in quick session  
  
__Item:__ N/A  
  
## Remarks:  
___  
- It is used either to reposition oneself in battle or to quickly close the distance against an opponent  
- By chaining multiple dashes together in quick succession, one can reach their target faster while making it harder for others to predict their movements, compared to a straightforward dash  
- One must be certain of the path before dashing, as there’s limited control once you initiate the dash. If an obstacle is in the way, there’s no way to stop yourself from crashing into it  
- A great way to counter this spell is by releasing a bunch of objects into the air, making it difficult for someone to find a clear path to dash  
- Force is applied in two ways: the position they are standing in, and the direction they want to propel forward. When these two factors are combined, one can jump in any direction within a 180-degree angle  
- One can dash without a platform to propel themselves off, but it is significantly weaker  
  
## Synergy:  
___  
- $1cr : Offers a solid platform while airborne to propel yourself off, enhancing your bust of speed
