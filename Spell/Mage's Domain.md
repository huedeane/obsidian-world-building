## Remarks:  
___  
- Spells naturally cast within your spiritual barrier are more efficient, with increased power and casting speed compared to those outside it.  
- Expanding the barrier to cover your surroundings allows the effect to take hold more quickly, as the increased range of the domain lets your soul spread out further  
- In battle, one might expand their barrier to encompass the opponent in an attempt to end the fight quickly. However, this is extremely dangerous, as anything within the barrier can strike directly at your soul, bypassing physical defenses. Alternatively, they could attack the barrier itself, causing your soul to leak out.
